Describtion:
  
  This is a checkers game with the use of html, css and javascript. Players play on opposite ends of the board. There are 2 different colors each belonging to the different players. And whoever captures all their opponents’ checkers wins.


Rules:
  -- Pieces can only move diagonally on dark squares.
  -- At the start of the game, pieces can only move forward, meaning toward the opposite player’s side.
  -- Pieces may move up and down when they become “kings” by reaching the last row of the opposite side.
  -- You are only allowed to move one piece per turn, moving one space at a time unless jumping to take one of your opponent's piece which the opponent's piece is removed from the board.
  -- Your opponent’s piece is removed from the board by jumping them if your piece is diagonal to your opponent’s and there is an empty dark space to hop to. Jump the checker by moving your piece straight over theirs and landing on the empty dark space.
  -- As you make your way across the board, try to get to the end of your opponent’s side. Once you reach the last row that piece becomes a king and can move forward or backward diagonally.
  -- Whoever captures all their opponents’ checkers wins.
